1. Description
  Quora is a place to gain and share knowledge about anything. Itâ€™s a platform to ask questions and connect with people who contribute unique insights and quality answers. This empowers people to learn from each other and to better understand the world.

  Over 100 million people visit Quora every month, so it's no surprise that many people ask similarly worded questions. Multiple questions with the same intent can cause   seekers to spend more time finding the best answer to their question, and make writers feel they need to answer multiple versions of the same question. Quora values     canonical questions because they provide a better experience to active seekers and writers, and offer more value to both of these groups in the long term.

2. Aim :- The aim of this project is to predict which of the provided pairs of questions contain two questions with the same meaning. 

3. Data Fileds :
* id - the id of a training set question pair
* qid1, qid2 - unique ids of each question (only available in train.csv)
* question1, question2 - the full text of each question
* is_duplicate - the target variable, set to 1 if question1 and question2 have essentially the same meaning, and 0 otherwise.
